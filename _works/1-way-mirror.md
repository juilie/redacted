  1-Way Mirror is an evening-length dance theater piece that explores themes of
  transmasculine identity.


  1-Way Mirror started with a personal question: are you still your mother’s daughter if you are no longer a woman? To embark on this disentanglement, we developed a practice of ‘doppelgangering’, an experiment of psychoanalytic introjection (the unconscious adoption of another’s characteristics). The practice involves uninterrupted durational mirroring; investigating queerness retroactively through our childhoods. The resulting scores utilize vectors, intuitive movement and layered monologue. In a political reality defined by polarization, we aim to explore conflict, power and dependency from a point of convergence.
